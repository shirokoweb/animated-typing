# animated-typing

Simple and very light-weight javascript to animate text.

## Usage :

Import script by linking it to your project:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>`

Inside a span tag with "typewrite" class, add the text you want to animate: data-type='[ "arg1", "arg2", "arg3", "arg4" ]

```html
<p>
  Find best deals on fresh <span class="typewrite" data-period="2000" data-type='[ "apples", "bananas", "strawberries", "grapes" ]'>
  <span class="wrap"></span></span> on the market !
</p>
```
